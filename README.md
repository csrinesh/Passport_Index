# Analysis on the Global power of passports
A passport is a travel document issued by a countryâ€™s government to its citizens that verifies the identity and nationality of the holder for the purpose of international travel. Earlier forms of passports have been historically used in ancient China and Islamic Caliphates to determine a persons ability to travel through different administrative regions present in those times. Passport in a modern sense is widely credited to Henry V of England as a means of helping his subjects to establish identity in foreign territories. These days with standaridization, machine readability and introduction of biometrics has made passports very secure and a cruicial identity card outside the country's border. However all passports are not made equal even though issued to an individual by its government. The strength is often related to the influence of the country in the global scene.
